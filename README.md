# Custom Lang
Custom Lang Pack for Minecraft

# Want to Help out
All is welcome to help... all you have to do is make a .lang to get added to the pack...

# Lang Format
I have an [Example Lang](https://github.com/Goldninja100gn/lang/blob/master/assets/minecraft/lang/Example.lang) File (The normal English one). After you make a custom one you have to call it 00_11.lang (00 your choice of 2 letters related to your name; 11 what the lang file is, 2 letters also; Example GN_DK.lang for Goldninja100gN_DontKnow.lang; Please do use only 2 letters)
